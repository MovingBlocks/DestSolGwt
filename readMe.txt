Partially implemented GWT facade for Destination Sol. Needs more work!

IntelliJ was able to build js code, but couldn't assemble the final artifact.

"artifactTemplate" was created manually, and the JS updated in that template to have an app.

As of this update the LibGDX Gradle template is back and play and this may work, but needs testing and tweaking.
